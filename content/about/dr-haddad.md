Dr. Haddad graduated in 1987 from the University of Texas Health Science Center Dental Branch. Upon graduation, he was commissioned as an officer in the US Army and completed the Advanced General Dentistry Program.

For the next 8 years, Dr. Haddad practiced general dentistry and earned his Fellowship of the Academy of General Dentistry in 1995. He then pursued the field he truly loved the most, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. Dr. Haddad completed his residency in 2001 at Tripler Army Medical Center in Hawaii. He also attained board certification in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Dental Anesthesiology.

After his residency, Dr. Haddad was assigned to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C. He spent the rest of his time in the military as a mentor in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Program. He has treated hundreds of soldiers, many of whom had extensive and complex facial trauma. Upon his completion of 20 years of military service, Dr. Haddad decided to pursue civilian practice. He was honored to receive the “Educator of the Year” award before he transitioned to civilian life.

Dr. Haddad practiced with Associated Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons for one year then built his private practice in Howard County. After thirteen years in private practice, Dr. Haddad sold his practice and decided to return to work with Associated Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Dr. Haddad’s passion for education was exemplified by earning two master’s degrees (Health Administration and Financial Planning) during his time in private practice.
