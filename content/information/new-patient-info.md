During your first visit to our office, you can expect a comprehensive and informative experience. Our highly skilled medical professionals will begin by conducting a consultation, where they will take the time to explain your diagnosis in detail, along with various treatment options available. We understand that every patient is unique, and we aim to create an individualized plan tailored specifically for you.

In some cases, if suitable, surgery may be performed on the same day as the consultation itself – ensuring convenience and efficiency for our patients. However, certain situations, such as complex medical histories or intricate treatment plans, may require further evaluation and necessitate a second appointment on another day for proper treatment delivery. Rest assured that our dedicated team is committed to providing you with exceptional care throughout this process.

## What To Bring To Your Appointment

Please provide us with the following information at the time of your consultation:

- **Surgical referral slip and any X-rays**: It is essential to bring your surgical referral slip along with any relevant X-rays or imaging reports to provide our team with a comprehensive understanding of your medical history. These documents serve as crucial references for our specialists, enabling them to accurately assess your condition and plan the best course of action for you.
- **List of medications you are presently taking**: To ensure the highest level of care, it is imperative that you share a detailed list of all the medications you are currently taking during your consultation. This includes prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and supplements. By having this information readily available, we can evaluate potential drug interactions or side effects that may impact the success of your treatment.
- **Medical or dental insurance forms**: If you possess medical or dental insurance coverage, kindly bring the necessary completed forms to expedite claim processing at our clinic. Providing these details in advance will save valuable time during your appointment so that we can focus on addressing your concerns effectively without unnecessary delays.
- **Patient registration forms**: Filling out the required patient registration forms before arriving for your appointment ensures a seamless check-in process upon arrival. These forms contain vital personal information such as contact details, medical history questionnaires, and consent forms – all designed to facilitate efficient communication between our staff and yourself while adhering strictly to privacy regulations.

**IMPORTANT - We kindly request that patients under 18 years old be accompanied by a parent or guardian during their consultation visit.**

## Other Important Instructions

A preoperative consultation and physical examination are compulsory for patients who are undergoing IV anesthesia for surgery. This crucial step ensures the safety and well-being of each patient throughout their surgical journey. In order to optimize your experience, it is imperative that you adhere to specific guidelines provided by our medical team.

- Firstly, please abstain from consuming any food or beverages for a minimum of eight hours prior to your scheduled surgery. This fasting period helps prevent potential complications during anesthesia administration, as an empty stomach reduces the risk of aspiration into the lungs.
- Additionally, we kindly request that you arrange for an adult companion who can drive you home following the procedure since certain effects of anesthesia may impair your ability to operate a vehicle safely.
- It is vital that we are aware of any underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, artificial heart valves or joints, and rheumatic fever, among others, which could significantly affect your treatment plan or recovery process.
- Similarly important is disclosing all medications you are currently taking, including heart medications, aspirin regimens, or anticoagulant therapies. This information enables us to tailor your anesthesia accordingly and minimize any potential risks associated with drug interactions or adverse reactions. Your safety and comfort remain our utmost priority throughout this entire process.

## X-Rays

If your dentist or physician has taken X-rays, please request that they promptly forward them to our office. We understand the value of time and efficiency, but in the event that immediate transfer is not feasible, we would greatly appreciate it if you could personally pick up the X-rays and bring them to our facility at your earliest convenience.

Our team recognizes the significance of having all relevant information readily available for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Should further imaging be deemed necessary, rest assured that our state-of-the-art facility can cater to those needs professionally and efficiently.

## i-CAT 3D Cone Beam Scanner

Our practice is proud to incorporate state-of-the-art, full-cranial cone-beam CT (computed tomography) technology into our dental services. This advanced technology allows us to obtain highly accurate 3D radiographic images that are crucial for the diagnosis, planning, and treatment of various oral surgery procedures.

In addition to its application in oral surgery, this cutting-edge technology also proves invaluable in orthodontics, implantology, airway assessment, and other dental procedures. By utilizing this innovative tool, we can generate undistorted views of the jaws, teeth, and facial bones with exceptional anatomical accuracy. The generated images include cross-sectional (bucco-lingual), axial, coronal, and sagittal views, as well as cephalometric and panoramic views.

Unlike traditional 2D technologies that limit our understanding of complex anatomical structures and patient care possibilities, these three-dimensional images provide an unprecedented level of precision, enabling us to deliver unparalleled patient care. With the integration of cone-beam CT technology into our office's repertoire of tools, we reaffirm our commitment to delivering innovative solutions alongside high-quality patient care.
