For your convenience, we accept Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express as forms of payment. Our utmost priority is to provide the finest care to our patients while ensuring that costs remain reasonable. To facilitate a seamless experience for all parties involved, we kindly request payment at the time services are rendered unless prior arrangements have been made.

We understand that financial matters can occasionally be complex or lead to misunderstandings. Thus, if you ever require clarification regarding your account or any questions arise, please do not hesitate to contact us directly. A simple telephone call can often resolve any uncertainties swiftly and efficiently.

Please remember, as our valued client, that you are fully responsible for all fees charged by this office, regardless of your insurance coverage.

We understand that managing your insurance payments can be a complex process, but rest assured, we are here to assist you every step of the way. As part of our commitment to transparency and effective communication, we will send you a monthly statement outlining all the necessary details regarding your insurance claims.

It is important to note that most insurance companies typically respond within four to six weeks after we submit your claim. However, should there be any delay or discrepancy in reflecting your insurance payment on the statement within this time frame, we kindly request you to contact our office promptly. We aim for accuracy and want to ensure that everything aligns with your coverage as expected.

Nevertheless, it is vital for us to inform you that any remaining balance after your insurance has been paid becomes solely your responsibility. Your prompt remittance is highly appreciated as it allows us to maintain seamless operations and deliver quality healthcare services without interruptions.

In case you anticipate difficulties in settling the remaining balance upfront, please remember that arrangements for a monthly payment plan can be made. However, it must be implemented prior to scheduling the actual procedure through open dialogue with our team of financial experts, who are more than willing to guide you through this process efficiently and effectively.
