Oral pathology refers to the specialized field of dentistry that focuses on the study, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases affecting the oral cavity. It involves examining various conditions that can occur in the mouth, such as infections, tumors, cysts, and other abnormalities.

The oral cavity is a complex structure composed of different tissues and organs like the lips, tongue, gums, salivary glands, and throat. Just like any other part of our body, these structures are susceptible to diseases and disorders.

One common condition that falls under oral pathology is oral cancer. This type of cancer can affect any area within the mouth or throat. It usually manifests through symptoms like persistent sores or ulcers that do not heal, unexplained bleeding or numbness in the mouth or lips, and difficulty swallowing or speaking clearly. Oral cancer screenings and diagnoses for specific conditions like lesions or infections caused by bacteria or viruses are carried out by specialists trained in oral pathology.

## Symptoms of Oral Cancer

One common symptom of oral cancer is persistent mouth pain or discomfort. This could include a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, or a feeling that something is stuck in your throat. Other symptoms may include unexplained bleeding, numbness, or tingling in the mouth or lips and changes in voice quality.

If you notice any unusual growths or sores in your mouth that do not heal within two weeks, it's important to get them checked out by a dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible. These can be warning signs of oral cancer. Other potential symptoms to watch for include white patches inside your mouth, red or white lesions on your tongue or gums, persistent bad breath, and loose teeth without any apparent cause.

## How Often Should You Get Screened for Oral Cancer?

Regular screenings for oral cancer are crucial in detecting the disease early and increasing the chances of successful treatment. The frequency of screenings may vary depending on your individual risk factors and medical history.

It is generally recommended that adults undergo an oral cancer screening at least once a year. This can be done during your routine dental check-up with your dentist or by an oral surgeon. However, if you have certain risk factors, such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, or a family history of oral cancer, more frequent screenings may be necessary.

During an oral cancer screening, our surgeon will examine your mouth for any abnormalities, such as sores, lumps, or discolored patches. They may also feel the tissues in your mouth and throat to check for any unusual growths or masses.

Remember that prevention is key when it comes to maintaining good oral health. By practicing healthy habits like quitting smoking and limiting alcohol intake, along with regular dental visits and screenings for early detection of potential problems â€“ including oral pathology - you can take control of your overall well-being!
