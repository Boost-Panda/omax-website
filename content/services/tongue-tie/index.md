Tongue tie, medically known as ankyloglossia, is a condition present at birth where the lingual frenulum, the tissue connecting the tongue to the floor of the mouth, is abnormally short, thick, or tight. This restriction can limit the tongue's range of motion, impacting various functions such as speaking, swallowing, and breastfeeding. Symptoms of tongue-tie may include difficulty sticking out the tongue, challenges with breastfeeding or latching onto a bottle, speech difficulties, and oral hygiene issues. In severe cases, tongue tie can affect overall oral and facial development. Treatment options vary depending on the severity of the condition and may include frenotomy or frenuloplasty to improve tongue mobility and alleviate associated symptoms. Early identification and intervention are crucial for addressing tongue ties and preventing potential complications.
