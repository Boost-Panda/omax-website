Implant-supported dentures, also known as implant-retained dentures or overdentures, are a modern dental solution designed to provide stability and functionality for individuals who have lost most or all of their natural teeth. Unlike traditional removable dentures that rely on suction or adhesive for support, implant-supported dentures are anchored securely in place by dental implants.

Dental implants are titanium posts that are surgically placed into the jawbone beneath the gums. These posts act as artificial tooth roots, providing a strong foundation for attaching the denture prosthetic. Typically, four to six implants are strategically positioned along the gumline to ensure optimal stability and support.

## The Procedure for Implant-Supported Dentures

The first step in getting implant-supported dentures is a thorough examination by one of our oral surgeons. They will evaluate your oral health, take X-rays and 3D scans of your mouth, and determine if you are a good candidate for the procedure.

If you are deemed eligible for implant-supported dentures, the next step involves placing dental implants into your jawbone. This is done through a surgical procedure where the metal posts are implanted into the bone to serve as anchors for the denture appliance.

After the implants have been placed, there will be a healing period during which osseointegration occurs. This process allows the implants to fuse with your jawbone, providing stability and support. Once adequate healing has taken place, abutments (connecting pieces) will be attached to the dental implants. These abutments act as connectors between the implants and the final denture appliance.

Custom-made dentures that fit securely over the dental implants will be created specifically for you. Implant-supported dentures provide better stability when speaking or eating compared to traditional removable options.

## The Advantages of Implant-Supported Dentures

Here are some of the main advantages of implant-supported dentures to consider:

- **Improved Stability**: Unlike traditional dentures, which rely on adhesives or suction to stay in place, implant-supported dentures are anchored securely by dental implants. This provides excellent stability, allowing you to eat, speak, and smile with confidence.

- **Enhanced Comfort**: The secure attachment of implant-supported dentures eliminates the discomfort often associated with loose-fitting traditional dentures. With implant-supported dentures, you can enjoy eating your favorite foods without worrying about your prosthetic slipping or rubbing against your gums.

- **Natural Appearance**: Implant-supported dentures are designed to closely resemble natural teeth. They can be customized in terms of shape, color, and size to match your existing teeth seamlessly, resulting in a natural-looking smile.

- **Preserve Jawbone Health**: When teeth are lost or extracted, the jawbone gradually deteriorates due to lack of stimulation from tooth roots. However, dental implants used with implant-supported dentures stimulate the jawbone just like natural tooth roots do, helping maintain its strength and density over time.

- **Longevity**: With proper care and maintenance, implant-supported dentures can last for many years or even decades before requiring replacement compared to traditional removable options that may need frequent adjustments or replacements.
