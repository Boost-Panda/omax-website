Canine exposure is a crucial dental procedure that aims to guide unerupted canines into their correct positions in the dental arch. By working with our skilled surgeons at Associated Oral & Maxillofacial Surgeons, patients experiencing issues with these teeth can find relief and improve their oral health.

## Common Issues With Unerupted Canines

Unerupted canines, also known as impacted canines, occur when these crucial teeth fail to emerge properly from the gum line. This condition can lead to a range of dental issues and complications if not addressed in a timely manner.

- One common issue associated with unerupted canines is overcrowding. When the canine teeth do not come in properly, they may cause other teeth to shift or become misaligned. This can result in crooked or crowded teeth, which can affect both the appearance and function of your smile.
- Another problem that arises from unerupted canines is the formation of cysts or tumors. When a canine tooth remains trapped beneath the gum tissue, it creates a pocket where fluid and debris may accumulate over time. This buildup increases the risk of developing painful cysts or tumors.
- Additionally, unerupted canines often cause bite problems and chewing difficulties. Since these teeth play an essential role in biting and chewing food, their absence or misalignment may hinder proper jaw function and impact overall oral health.
- If left untreated for an extended period, unerupted canines could lead to long-term consequences such as increased susceptibility to tooth decay, gum disease, and even bone loss around affected areas.

## The Canine Exposure Procedure

Canine exposure is a specialized dental procedure that aims to guide unerupted canines into their correct positions in the dental arch. It involves creating a small incision in the gum tissue and applying orthodontic forces over time to help bring these important teeth into alignment.

First, a thorough examination is conducted and diagnostic imaging is used to determine the exact positioning of the impacted canine. This allows the surgeon to plan for the best approach during the procedure. Once ready, local anesthesia is administered to ensure patient comfort throughout the process.

The surgeon then makes a small incision in the gum tissue, carefully exposing the impacted tooth. In some cases, it may be necessary to remove any overlying bone or tissue obstructing its eruption path.

After exposing the canine, an orthodontic bracket or chain is bonded onto it using dental adhesive. This allows for precise control and application of orthodontic forces through regular adjustments made by the surgeon. Over time, as these gentle forces are applied and adjusted periodically, gradual movement of the impacted canine occurs toward its ideal position within the dental arch. Regular check-ups with the surgeon will monitor progress until successful eruption is achieved.

## The Benefits of Canine Exposure

Here are some key advantages of canine exposure:

- **Improved Bite Alignment**: Unerupted canines can disrupt the harmony of your bite, causing misalignment or overcrowding. By bringing these teeth into the proper position, canine exposure helps create a balanced and functional bite.

- **Enhanced Oral Hygiene**: Unerupted canines often trap food particles in the gum tissue surrounding them, increasing the risk of plaque buildup and gum disease. Canine exposure allows easier access for brushing and flossing, promoting better oral hygiene.

- **Prevention of Damage to Adjacent Teeth**: When unerupted canines remain below the gum line, they may exert pressure on neighboring teeth, leading to displacement or damage over time. Canine exposure prevents potential dental issues by guiding these teeth into their correct alignment.

- **Preservation of Bone Structure**: Unerupted canines may cause resorption or loss of bone structure in the jaw area due to prolonged impaction. By exposing and aligning these teeth properly, canine exposure helps preserve healthy bone density.

- **Aesthetically Pleasing Smile**: With properly aligned canines, your smile will appear more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing overall.

- **Boost in Confidence**: Correcting dental issues through canine exposure not only improves physical appearance but also enhances self-confidence and self-esteem.
