Dental implants are advanced restorative solutions that replace missing teeth by surgically implanting biocompatible titanium posts into the jawbone, serving as artificial tooth roots. These implants provide a stable foundation for various prosthetic restorations, such as crowns, bridges, or dentures, restoring both functionality and aesthetics to the smile. With benefits including improved chewing ability, jawbone structure preservation, shifting teeth prevention, and long-term durability, dental implants offer a permanent and natural-looking solution for individuals seeking to regain confidence and oral health following tooth loss.

## Types of Dental Implants

- **Endosteal Implants**: Endosteal implants are the most common dental implant surgically placed directly into the jawbone. These implants resemble small screws or cylinders and provide a stable foundation for prosthetic teeth. Endosteal implants are suitable for patients with adequate jawbone density and are used to support single crowns, bridges, or dentures.

- **Subperiosteal Implants**: Subperiosteal implants are placed on the jawbone, just beneath the gum tissue. Unlike endosteal implants, which are inserted directly into the bone, subperiosteal implants consist of a metal framework that rests on the jawbone and is secured with screws. Subperiosteal implants are often recommended for patients with insufficient bone density or those who are unable to undergo bone augmentation procedures. Contact us today!

- **Zygomatic Implants**: Zygomatic implants are longer than traditional dental implants and are anchored in the zygomatic (cheek) bone instead of the maxillary (upper jaw) bone. These implants are used when there is insufficient bone in the upper jaw, often due to bone loss following tooth loss or periodontal disease. Zygomatic implants provide a stable foundation for prosthetic teeth and eliminate the need for bone grafting procedures.

- **All-on-4/All-on-6 Implants**: All-on-4 and All-on-6 implants are innovative solutions for patients missing all or most of their teeth in one or both dental arches. These implant-supported prostheses use a strategic placement of four or six dental implants to support an entire arch of teeth (either fixed or removable). All-on-4/All-on-6 implants offer immediate function and aesthetics, allowing patients to regain their smile and chewing ability in a single appointment.

- **Mini Implants**: Mini implants are smaller in diameter than traditional implants and are often used in cases where there is limited bone volume or for stabilizing removable dentures. These implants require less invasive surgery and a quicker recovery than standard implants. Mini implants can be an excellent option for patients with thin or narrow jawbones who may not be candidates for traditional implant placement.

## The Procedure of Dental Implants

**Initial Consultation and Treatment Planning:**

- The process begins with a comprehensive dental examination, including X-rays, CT scans, and impressions of the teeth and jaws. This evaluation helps us assess the patient's oral health, bone density, and suitability for dental implants.
- A customized treatment plan is developed based on the evaluation results and the patient's specific needs and goals. This plan outlines the number of implants needed, the type of implant, and the proposed timeline for treatment.

**Surgical Placement of Implants:**

- If the jawbone lacks sufficient density or volume to support dental implants, [bone grafting](/services/bone-grafting) or augmentation procedures may be necessary to build up the bone. This step ensures a strong foundation for the implants and enhances treatment success.
- During the surgical procedure we make an incision in the gum tissue to expose the underlying jawbone. The implant posts are strategically placed into the jawbone at predetermined locations using precision instruments. The number and placement of implants depend on the patient's treatment plan.
- After implant placement, the gums are closed, and a temporary restoration may be placed over the implants to protect them during the healing process. Over the next few months, osseointegration occurs, during which the implants fuse with the surrounding bone tissue, providing stability and support.

**Abutment Placement and Restoration:**

- Sometimes, a healing abutment may be placed on top of the implants during the healing period to shape the gum tissue and facilitate proper healing around the implant site.
- Once osseointegration is complete, the gums are reopened, and abutments (connector pieces) are attached to the implants. These abutments serve as anchors for the final prosthetic restoration.
- Impressions of the abutments and surrounding teeth are taken to fabricate a custom-made prosthetic restoration, such as a crown, bridge, or denture.
- The final step involves attaching the prosthetic restoration to the abutments and completing the dental implant procedure. The restoration is carefully adjusted for proper fit, function, and aesthetics, restoring confidence in the patient's ability to chew, speak, and smile.
