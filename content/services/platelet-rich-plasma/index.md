Platelet-rich plasma, commonly known as PRP, is a cutting-edge treatment that has gained popularity in recent years. PRP involves using a patient's own blood to extract platelets and plasma. Platelets are tiny cells responsible for clotting and healing damaged tissues, while plasma is the liquid portion of blood containing important growth factors.

## How Does It Work?

To create PRP, a small amount of blood is drawn from the patient and then placed in a centrifuge machine. This machine spins at high speed, separating the different components of the blood based on their weight. The concentrated platelets are then extracted and combined with the plasma to form PRP.

Once prepared, PRP can be injected directly into injured or damaged areas of the body. The growth factors present in platelets help stimulate tissue regeneration and accelerate healing processes. Additionally, these growth factors attract stem cells to the site of injury, aiding in repair and promoting new cell growth.

It's important to note that not all patients may be suitable candidates for PRP treatment. A thorough evaluation by the surgeon is necessary to determine if this therapy is appropriate for you.

## Why Use Platelet-Rich Plasma?

PRP allows the body to utilize its natural healing processes at an accelerated pace. This involves a rush of various cells to the wound, including platelets. These platelets have multiple functions, such as forming blood clots and releasing growth factors (GF) into the site.

These GFs (platelet-derived growth factors PGDF, transforming growth factor beta TGF, and insulin-like growth factor ILGF) aid in repairing the body by stimulating stem cells to generate new tissue. The greater the amount of growth factors sequestered in the wound, the more stimulated stem cells will be to produce new host tissue. PRP enables faster and more effective healing for the body.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) is a subfamily of TGF. Research studies in animals and humans have demonstrated the ability of BMP to stimulate bone growth. This is of great importance to dental implant surgeons. Now, implant surgeons are able to grow bone more predictably and more rapidly by adding PRP and BMP to the implant site with bone substitute particles.

## The Advantages of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy offers numerous advantages and benefits. These include:

- One major advantage of PRP is its natural approach. Unlike other treatments that involve synthetic substances or invasive procedures, PRP uses a concentrated form of the patient's own platelets, which contain growth factors that promote tissue repair and regeneration.
- PRP therapy is a safe procedure with minimal risks or side effects. Since it uses the patient's own blood, there is no risk of allergic reactions or infections. The procedure itself is minimally invasive and usually involves only mild discomfort or bruising at the injection site.
- PRP offers long-lasting results compared to conventional treatments. As it stimulates natural healing processes within the body, patients often experience sustained improvement over time rather than just temporary relief.
- For outpatient surgical procedures like placing dental implants, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) can be produced at the dental office.

In addition to these advantages, PRP treatment also promotes faster recovery times compared to traditional therapies. By accelerating tissue repair and reducing inflammation, patients may experience quicker pain relief and return to their normal activities sooner.
